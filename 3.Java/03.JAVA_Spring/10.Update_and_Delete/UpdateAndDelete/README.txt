Update and Delete
https://login.codingdojo.com/m/314/5657/37523

In this assignment, you will be implementing the update and delete methods and test the endpoints with Postman. Continue using the same mvc project that we have been using so far. Here is some controller code to get you started.

src/main/java/com/codingdojo/mvc/controllers/BooksApi.java
// ..
import com.codingdojo.mvc.models.Book;
import com.codingdojo.mvc.services.BookService;
@RestController
public class BooksApi {
    private final BookService bookService;
    public BooksApi(BookService bookService){
        this.bookService = bookService;
    }
    // other methods removed for brevity
    @RequestMapping(value="/api/books/{id}", method=RequestMethod.PUT)
    public Book update(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @RequestParam(value="title") String title, @RequestParam(value="description") String desc, @RequestParam(value="language") String lang, @RequestParam(value="pages") Integer numOfPages) {
        Book book = bookService.updateBook(id, title, desc, lang, numOfPages);
        return book;
    }
    
    @RequestMapping(value="/api/books/{id}", method=RequestMethod.DELETE)
    public void destroy(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
        bookService.deleteBook(id);
    }
}copy
Your task is to write the service methods that will correctly update and delete a book. To update a book, you will have to use the setter methods from the domain model and then call the save method. As you can see, save is used for both creating and updating. To delete a book, you will have to use the deleteById method. Below, I have linked to the CrudRepository documentation.
