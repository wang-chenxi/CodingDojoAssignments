# Why Python?

1. **Readability** - Python is designed to be, what we call, `English Readable`. It closely resembles English with punctuation rules that promote consistent format.
2. **Libraries** - Python has been around for more than twenty years. Longer lifespan means more things have been created, many of which are made available to us. 
3. **Community** - Python has a massive community built around it. Generally, the people that contribute the most to this community are the most passionate, and by extension, the most knowledgeable (sp??). 
4. **Scope** - Python is very flexible, but not as loose as JavaScript. Also, Python was made for way more than just front end scripting, so if you can think of a project idea, you can almost certainly accomplish it with Python.
