# What is Object Oriented Programming?

There are several different types of Programming. There's `functional programming` (heavy use of functions, sometimes within functions), `procedural programming` (instructions to be executed from top to bottom sequentially), and `object oriented programming`.

## What Do We Mean by Object Oriented?

If you remember, objects can contain information (`attributes`), and functions (`methods`). These methods can be used to perform any functionality to modify or utilize other parts of the object. Basically, we're making our own programming swiss army knives!

But rather than just creating objects on the fly, we will be creating `Classes`, which is like a blueprint that will be used to make variations of the same type of `Object`. Each `instance` of the `Class` will have the same `attributes` and `methods`, though the information stored in those `attributes` will likely be different!
