# Email Validation with DB

1. Create a new Flask project

2. Create a new database with a table containing an email address field

3. Set up the root route to display a form to input an email address

4. Validate that the email is in the correct format

5. If invalid, redirect to the root route with an error message

6. If valid, redirect to the success route that displays a success message

7. Have the success route template also display a list of all the email's in the database

8. NINJA Bonus: Also validate that the email being added is unique

9. NINJA Bonus: Add a delete button on the success route allowing for the deletion of a specific email from the database
