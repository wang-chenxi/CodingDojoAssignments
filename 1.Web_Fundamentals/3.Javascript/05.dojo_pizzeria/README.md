### Create a function called pizzaOven. We should feel free to customize what information we keep track of for our pizza, but let's make sure that we include the following: crustType, sauceType, cheeses, and toppings.

* Create a function called pizzaOven that returns a JavaScript (Pizza) Object

* Create a pizza with: "deep dish", "traditional", ["mozzarella"], and ["pepperoni", "sausage"]

* Create a pizza with: "hand tossed", "marinara", ["mozzarella", "feta"], and ["mushrooms", "olives", "onions"]

* Create 2 more pizzas with any toppings we like!

* Bonus Challenge: Create a function called randomPizza that uses Math.random() to create a random pizza!
