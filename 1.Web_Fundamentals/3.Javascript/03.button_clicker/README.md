# Button Clicker 
## https://login.codingdojo.com/m/201/7508/53231 

### Objectives
** Practice using the onclick event
** Combine what we've learned of HTML, CSS and JS
** Recreate the layout you see below. It may be helpful to focus on getting the HTML and CSS completed before adding the JS functionality to the page.

### Bonus Challenges
* Ninja Bonus: Login Button

    - The assignment already asks to change the text to say Logout when clicking the Login button. But can you find a way to make it switch back to Login if you click the Logout button?

* Ninja Bonus: Like button

    - The assignment has you make an alert pop up when you click the Likes button. But can you make it change the text to increment how many likes there are too?

* Sensei Bonus: Like button

    - Rather than hard coding the alert, can you find a way to have the alert grab the title of the associated section and put it into the alert?
    - i.e. if the first "card" has a title of "ninja", and you click its like button, the alert says "ninja was liked," but if the second "card" has a title of "sensei", the alert says "sensei was liked", by calling the SAME function for both button clicks
