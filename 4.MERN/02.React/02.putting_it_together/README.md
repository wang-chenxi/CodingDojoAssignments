Hi there, I try to put every piece of assignment together since creating new react project takes huge resource. Thank you for your understanding.

# 1.Putting it Together

https://login.codingdojo.com/m/130/6235/43911

Using the same assignment as the Prop It Up assignment, create a birthday button that will increase one person's age by one.

================================================

# 2. Big Inversion

https://login.codingdojo.com/m/130/6335/50225

Redo the Prop It Up assignment and turn the class components into functional components.

Create a component called PersonCard that accepts the following props:

firstName
lastName
age
hairColor
Then, display four PersonCard components that show four different people, using props.

# 3. Hook Form

Create a form like the following wireframe with a React Component and hooks. Then, show in real time, the data that is being inputted into the form below

# 4. More Forms

Using the previous assignment "Hook Form", add error messages.

If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
If the email is less than 5 characters, output an error message saying the field must be at least 5 characters.
The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.

Hint: Use state and conditional rendering.
