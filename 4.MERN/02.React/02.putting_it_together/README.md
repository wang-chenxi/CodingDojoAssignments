# Putting it Together

Using the same assignment as the Prop It Up assignment, create a birthday button that will increase one person's age by one.

# Big Inversion

Redo the Prop It Up assignment and turn the class components into functional components.

Create a component called PersonCard that accepts the following props:

firstName
lastName
age
hairColor
Then, display four PersonCard components that show four different people, using props.
