/*
    Let's practice recursion now!

    factorial(num) -> find the factorial of a number.
    Example: factorial(5) should give us 120, because
    5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 120

    BONUS: findNthFibNum(n) 
    Find the nth value of the fibonacci sequence.

    Fibonacci sequence:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... 

    Where the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1, and then each consecutive value is the sum 
    of the previous 2 numbers

    So findNthFibNum(7) would return 8, because 8 is the 7th number in the fibonacci sequence.

        result = 1;
    } else {

    }
    return result;

console.log(factorial(5));
