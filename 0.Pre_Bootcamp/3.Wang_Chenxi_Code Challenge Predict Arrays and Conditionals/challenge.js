// Assignment: Create T-diagrams to predict the output for the following code snippets. 

// Directions: 

// For each code snippet, create a T-diagram. 
// Create a single text document or photograph of your T-Diagrams that contains the 3 T-diagrams for the code snippets below and submit it.
// Reminder: This is an opportunity for you to build the habit of showing up for yourself. We won't be reviewing your work, AND your brain needs this workout. Remember, practice a skill regardless of whether a coach or teacher or boss or peer will look at it. This isn't school. This is a dojo.

Code Snippet 1
function displayContactInfo() {
    var auntContactInfo = ["Paula", "Smith", "1234 Main Street", "St. Louis", "MO", 12345];
    console.log(auntContactInfo);
}

// ["Paula", "Smith", "1234 Main Street", "St. Louis", "MO", 12345]

Code Snippet 2
function displayGrocerylist() {
    var produce = ["apples", "oranges"];

}

// ["broccoli", "ice cream", "hashbrowns"]
